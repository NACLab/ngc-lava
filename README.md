# NGC-Lava: Neuromorphic Models with NGC-Learn and Loihi 2

<b>ngc-lava</b> is a public repository for
<i><a href="https://github.com/NACLab/ngc-learn/">ngc-learn</a></i> support for 
converting and running models in the Loihi 2 Lava framework. This set of tools 
is useful for prototyping spiking neural network models in ngc-learn and then 
translating these to work in Lava simulation and/or on-chip.

For official walkthroughs going over the model exhibits found in this repo, please
visit the ngc-learn documentation page: https://ngc-learn.readthedocs.io/. 
For information, including anything related 
to usage instructions and details related to ngc-learn itself, please refer to
the official ngc-learn <a href="https://github.com/NACLab/ngc-learn/">repo</a> (and
its <a href="https://ngc-learn.readthedocs.io/">documentation</a>).
